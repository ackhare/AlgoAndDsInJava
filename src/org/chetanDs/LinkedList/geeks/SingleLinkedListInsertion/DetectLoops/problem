Other than Hashing and Floyd’s Cycle-Finding Algorithm:

Mark Visited Nodes:
This solution requires modifications to basic linked list data structure.
Have a visited flag with each node.  Traverse the linked list and keep marking visited
 nodes.
 If you see a visited node again then there is a loop.
 This solution works in O(n) but requires additional information with each node.
A variation of this solution that doesn’t require modification to basic data
 structure can be implemented using hash.  Just store the addresses of visited nodes
 in a hash and if you see an address that already exists in hash then there is a loop.
